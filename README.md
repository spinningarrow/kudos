## Building

Install [node][], clone this repo, and run the following commands from the
repo's directory:

    $ npm install    # install deps
    $ npm run build  # build app.js
    $ npm start      # start server

**TIP**: When writing code, it's easier if the files rebuild automatically. To
do this, run:

    $ npm run watch  # no more `npm run build`, yay!
